A ticketing system is a software program that a customer support team uses to create, manage, and maintain a list (or lists) of customer problems.

Of course, many ticketing systems also provide other functions including, but not limited to:

* Omnichannel support
* Ticket routing, categorization, and tagging
* Tracking and measurement
* Integrations
* Knowledge base management
* Automation
* Live chat

You might also hear ticketing systems referred to as ticketing software, ticketing support, or a helpdesk ticketing system.
